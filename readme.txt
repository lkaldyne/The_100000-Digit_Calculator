Hello and Welcome to the BigNum calculator!
Feel free to add and subtract integers as large as your heart desires!

In summary, this was a summer project dedicated to going beyond integer capacity and breaking addition down to its roots!

This program takes 2 inputs as dynamically allocated strings and breaks the large addition down into multiple sub-operations with short ints

The extra, small functions within main() are error handling that makes sure that the functions addemup() and subtractem() are always dealing with values that make sense to them (ex. cannot do long subtraction with top number being smaller than bottom number, cannot add or subtract negative numbers, must be made positive and ending sign flipped) 

Note: 

Multiplication is still at its early stages, so be wary of how large you choose your numbers to be when using the "*" operator.
